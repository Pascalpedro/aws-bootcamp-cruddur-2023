# FREE AWS CLOUD PROJECT BOOTCAMP
## Aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023

- Application: Cruddur
- Cohort: 2023-A1

This is the starting codebase that will be used in the FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp 2023

`Free AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp` is a training program designed to escalate and help AWS Cloud Practitioners & Cloud-computing enthusiasts (who already have a fundamental knowledge of AWS cloud concepts and other IT-related scopes) get exposed to hands-on practices and real-life projects using tools and scenarios that are applicable in a working organization.


The program has two main goals:

- The short-term goal of the Bootcamp project is to design and implement an app named “CRUDDUR”, a micro-blogging platform that will incorporate multiple AWS Cloud services and practices 
- while its long-term goal is targeted at equiping the trainees with advanced real-life scenario tech skills that will scale them over to a corporate AWS Cloud working environment.

Below is the sample of the landing page of the UI/UX of the CRUDDUR APP we are about to implement...
