# Aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023

Free AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp is a training program designed to escalate and help AWS Cloud Practitioners & Cloud-computing enthusiasts (who already have a fundamental knowledge of AWS cloud concepts and other IT-related scopes) get exposed to hands-on practices and real-life projects using tools and scenarios that are applicable in a working organization.
The short-term goal of the Bootcamp project is to design and implement an app named “CRUDDUR”, a micro-blogging platform that will incorporate multiple AWS Cloud services and practices while its long-term goal is targeting to equip the trainees with advanced real-life scenario tech skills that will scale them over to a corporate AWS Cloud working environment.
