# Week 1 — APP CONTAINERIZATION!!!

## Brief intro on Containeriaztion concepts...
Containerized applications are applications that run in isolated runtime environments called containers.
- Containers encapsulate an application with all its dependencies, including code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, binaries, configuration files and settings. 
- This all-in-one packaging makes an application portable by enabling it to behave consistently across different hosts—allowing developers to write once and run almost anywhere.
- These containerizations are made possible with the help of container management softwares like Docker, Kubernetes, AWS Fargate, Amazon ECS, etc.

For this particular task, we made use of Docker containerization tool which is one of the best container management services.

Refer to this link for a more detailed explanation of Docker. [Docker overview](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)

Some of the most important terms associated with it are containers, images, package, deploy, ship, etc.

Docker is used mainly because it has the ability to reduce the size of the deployment by providing a smaller footprint on the operating system via containers.

## IMPLEMENTATION & STEPS INVOLVED!!

- From my Github project repo [AWS BOOTCAMP CRUDDUR 2023](https://github.com/Pascalpedro/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023), i logged into my [gitpod CDE](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Pascalpedro/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023) 
which i have already setup with the necessary settings such as the *ENVIROMENTAL VARIABLES*, *GIT PROVIDER*, then choose *VS-CODE Browser* as the editor for opening the workspaces.
